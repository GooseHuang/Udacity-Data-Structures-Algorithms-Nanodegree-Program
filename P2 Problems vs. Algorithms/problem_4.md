I used a while loop here to iter-through all the nodes from both two sides. For each number iterated, it will be swapped to the end if it's 2 and swapped to the beginning if it's zero.

For time complexity, it will be O(n).
For space complexity, it will be O(n) to store all the list and only O(1) on each swap process, which is really good.
