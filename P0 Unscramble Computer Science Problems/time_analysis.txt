# Task0
O(1) -- As the program only takes the first and the last records

# Task1
O(n^2) -- As going through every line is O(n), checking if a element is in a set is O(n) in the worst case, the process will be n + 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n steps. So the whole process is O(n^2), while O(n) on average.

# Task2
O(n^2) -- As checking if an element is in dict, geting and settiing value is O(n) in the worst case, getting the max value from a dict is O(n), find the keys of item with a particular value is O(n), the pocess will be 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n + n + n steps. So the whole process is O(n^2).

# Task3
O(n^2) -- Iterating through a list is O(n). Converting a list to a set is O(n^2) in the worst case. The sort of a list is O(n*log(n)). So the whole process  is O(n^2). 

# Task4
O(n^2) -- The time complexity of set_S - Set_B is O(Set_A * Set_B) in the worst case, which will be O(n^2). The iterate process for text and call list will be O(n). Sorting is O(n*log(n)). So the whole process will be approximate to O(n^2)
